* Wrong caption in Figure 7?
* Better describe the basic functionality of Paxy without the code required to tolerate crashes or optimize the sorry messages
* The execution of proposers and acceptors in distributed nodes is not described nor demonstrated
* Acceptor must also save status in the disk when making a new promise
* Sorry optimization also can be applied in the vote function (not only in collect)

* When receiving 'prepare', in acceptor(Name, Promise, Voted, Accepted, PanelId), 'Promise' should be 'Round'. In the source code this is ok, so it seems a copy&paste problem
