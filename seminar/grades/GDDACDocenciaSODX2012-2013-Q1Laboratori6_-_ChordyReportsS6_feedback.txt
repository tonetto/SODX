You can check if your replication strategy works by modifying your create_probe and forward_probe methods to show information about the Store and the Replica, execute the following commands, and check the contents of the Store and the Replica.

> N2 = node4:start(2).
> P = chordy:connect(N2).
> P ! {add,0,0}.
> P ! {add,1,1}.
> P ! {add,2,2}.
> N2 ! probe.
> N0 = node4:start(0,N2).
> N2 ! probe.
> N1 = node4:start(1,N2).
> N2 ! probe.
> N1 ! stop.
> N2 ! probe.
> N0 ! stop.
> N2 ! probe.

* Replication does not work in some situations: wrong content of replica

MARRÓN VIDA, DIEGO

* Node4 does not work
* Replication is not demonstrated
* Demonstrations of ring management and node failure could be more user-friendly

CHACON, ALESSANDRO ENRIQUE

* Some replication details not described: what to do when a node is down
* Replication does not work properly: Replica stored at Predecessor instead of Successor

BORDALLO ESTOR, RUBEN

* Replication does not work: wrong store and replica sometimes
* Replication is not demonstrated

* Replication does not work properly: wrong store and replica sometimes
* In stabilize procedure:

Xpid ! {notify, {MyKey, self()}},
stabilize (Pred, MyKey, {Xkey, Xpid});

should be:

self() ! stabilize,
{Xkey, Xpid};

* Replication does not work properly: Replica stored at the same node instead of Successor
* Reduce the number of debug messages in the snapshots

NUHIC, ISAK

* There is not need to list all the code for the 4 versions of the node module. You'd better describe the incremental changes from one version with respect to the previous one
* Replication is not implemented
* node2 and node3 do not work
