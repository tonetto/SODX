* In section 3.4, it could be more appropriate to do several read and/or write operations per transaction instead of playing with the probability
* In section 3.5, it seems that your experiment is not evaluating the impact of different percentage of modified entries with respect to the total number of entries

CHACON, ALESSANDRO ENRIQUE
LEVEL RUIZ, ERNESTO ALFONSO

* Describe changes you did to execute server and clients in different machines
* Describe changes you did in the client to answer the open questions (when applicable) and
the default value of the parameters (the ones you are not evaluating) in each experiment

BORDALLO ESTOR, RUBEN
MORON DURAN, FRANCISCO DAVID

* Show the impact of different ratio of read and write operations per transaction
* Show the impact of different percentage of modified entries for transaction
* Discuss the changes to execute server and clients in different nodes
* To show the impact of the different parameters in the success rate you should do more exhaustive tests (test more values)
* The impact of the different parameters in the success rate can be better appreciated if represented graphically

FORERO SANCHEZ, PEDRO
CALDERON, GIANCARLO

* It seems that your experiment is not evaluating the impact of different ratio of read and write operations per transaction, because the ratio is always 1
* To show the impact of the different parameters in the success rate you should do more exhaustive tests (test more values)
* The impact of the different parameters in the success rate can be better appreciated if represented graphically

ZOGER, JIMMY
SEDAR, MOHOTTIGE ROSHAN

* It seems that the impact of different percentage of modified entries with respect to the total number of entries is not evaluated
* In some experiments, to show the impact of the different parameters in the success rate you should test more values
* The impact of the different parameters in the success rate can be better appreciated if represented graphically

DJAKOU DJATCHA, CHRISTIAN

* Better replace 'Added = [ {N , Entry , Value } | Writes ]' with 'Added = lists:keystore(N, 1, Writes,{N, Entry, Value})'
* To show the impact of the different parameters in the success rate you should do more exhaustive tests (test more values)
* The impact of the different parameters in the success rate can be better appreciated if represented graphically
* To evaluate the impact of the different percentage of modified entries with respect to the total number of entries on the success rate, the idea was every process can read/write a subset of the entries, but not necessarily the first ones

FAROKHMANESH, FARNOOSH
CUBERO LUQUE, LORENZO JESUS

* Better replace 'Added = [ {N , Entry , Value } | Writes ]' with 'Added = lists:keystore(N, 1, Writes,{N, Entry, Value})'
* You are not evaluating the impact of different percentage of modified entries with respect to the total number of entries
* Describe changes you did to execute server and clients in different machines
* Describe changes you did in the client to answer the open questions (when applicable) and
the default value of the parameters (the ones you are not evaluating) in each experiment

DEMETRIOU, CHARIS
DEMETRIOU, NICOS

* Some broken references (Figure ??)
* Describe changes you did to execute server and clients in different machines
* In some experiments, you should test more values to show the impact of some parameters in the success rate 
* Describe changes you did in the client to answer the open questions (when applicable) and
the default value of the parameters (the ones you are not evaluating) in each experiment

GANDUXE PREGONA, ORIOL
PARRAMÓN TUBELLA, ROGER

* Describe changes you did to execute server and clients in different machines
* To evaluate the impact of different duration of the transactions on the success rate, the idea was to add the delay after doing the read/write operation but before commit, not before doing the read/write operations
* To evaluate the impact of the different percentage of modified entries with respect to the total number of entries on the success rate, the idea was every process can read/write a subset of the entries, but not necessarily the first ones

GRMAN, PETER
TONETTO, LEONARDO

* Discuss also about the success rate in Experiment 3
* Present the default value of the parameters (the ones you are not evaluating) in each experiment

NUHIC, ISAK

* There are not experiments showing the impact on the success rate of:
- different number of entries in the store
- different duration of the transactions 
- different ratio of read and write operations per transaction
- different percentage of modified entries with respect to the total number of entries
* Describe changes you did to execute server and clients in different machines
